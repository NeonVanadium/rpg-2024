>> INTRO
You awaken on hard stone, high atop a tower that overlooks an unfamiliar landscape.
You have no memory--no idea who you are, nor why you're in this place.
Whatever is going on, whatever you choose to do, you gain nothing by staying put. You rise to your feet and survey your surroundings.

>> INTO_THE_WILDERNESS
You step off of the stone and onto the soft, grassy soil.
The wilderness around the tower is all thickly-grown jungle. Yet many trails crisscross the vegetation, providing easy enough means of travel in more or less any direction.
This doesn't look like any landscape you can recall--but then again, you can't recall much of anything.
The trails are the only indication of recent activity in the area. It's hard to say, what, exactly, lies down them. Though the tower, at least, appears safe, you have neither food nor water--staying put would eventually become as dangerous as losing your way out there in the jungle.
You have a strange feeling that you are being watched.
Once again, you take stock of your surroundings. The wild awaits.
