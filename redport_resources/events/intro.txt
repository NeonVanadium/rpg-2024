>> INTRO ; INTRO NOT COMPLETED
The sky is clear today, the air pleasantly warm and carrying the subtle scent of sea-salt.
This is the burgeoning city of Redport. Its buildings, mostly single-story, are iconic for their red-tile roofs and warm, beige walls. Except around a small fort on the east side, it has no walls. It was not built for crowds, but these days it is stuffed to the brim with people.
As you walk one of its wider streets, your eye is drawn to a massive, brightly-colored poster on a nearby building...
“The House Foxford Arena’s grand opening!" It reads. "Brave gladiators take on fearsome monsters! Riches and titles to be won! Combatants wanted!”
It is this that has drawn the crowds, and perhaps yourself, to Redport. Whatever one’s calling, there is work, prosperity, and fun to be found around an event like this.

>> GNOLLS_APPEAR ; PLAYER IN REDPORT_SQUARE
You enter a wide-open, bustling town square. Tightly-packed crowds jostle this way and that, and the signature city sounds of raucous chatter, haggling merchants, and rumbling carts fill you ears.
Suddenly, those sounds are replaced by screams.
As people flee in droves, you see the source of their horror emerging from a nearby alleyway...
Like hyenas twisted into the vagues shape of humanoids, three monstrous gnolls scurry out into the square, spit dribbling from their jaws as they brandish their spears.

>> INTRO_PRE_GNOLL_FIGHT
You study the scene ahead. Two guards push through the crowd and look on in shock at the scene in front of them, raising their halberds in slightly-trembling hands. But the gnolls seem less concerned by the guards than by... a light in the alley behind them.
Made seemingly of red-hot magma, a small creature the size of a human baby skips and hops out into the square. The air simmers around it, and it bares a glowing, white-hot smile--then hurls a glob of molten fire towards the gnolls.
The projectile hits the ground in a flash of smoke and embers, scattering the gnolls in a fit of snarls and hisses. The onlookers break into panic, loosing shrill cries of terror as they scramble to get away as fast as possible.
YELL ELERIE Let me through!
You hear a woman shout, then press through the scattering cloud of onlookers.

Brandishing a steel mace, she approaches the monsters.

>> WATCH_GNOLL_FIGHT_B
A brutal brawl ensues between three teams--the gnolls, the burning creature, and the guards and woman.
A gnoll scores a brutal hit on one of the guards, but together the two manage to take it down. The woman in red, however, is much more skilled. She skirts around the beasts, dispatching both the burning creature and the second gnoll with speed and precision.
As the corpses settle, with the one guard clutching a bleeding shoulder, the woman stares down at the melting corpse of the firey creature. It begins to glow.
YELL ELERIE Get back!
The woman jumps away, and the guards stumble back in confusion--just as the creature explodes.
The dust settles, leaving a charred black spot on the ground. The gnolls corpses remain, slightly singed. But besides this, all is still. The woman in red approaches the scene, and begins observing the remains.

LOG FOUGHT_GNOLLS
The three gnolls lie dead, and the child-like creature lays in a smoldering heap.
Then that heap begins to glow, first dimly, then brighter.
YELL ELERIE Get back!
The woman jumps away, and the guards stumble back in confusion--just as the creature explodes.
Shouts of surprise come from the distantly-gathered crowd of onlookers. The guards stumble back, staring on in shocked silence until the scene, finally, becomes silent and still. The red-robed woman runs to the remains and surveys the scene.

MOVE PLAYER 30 20
You run as fast as you can, putting the gnolls and the screaming crowds behind you.
You sprint down a zig-zagging sequence of roads and alleys, only stopping once you've fully lost your breath, and the commotion is so far behind that passers-by look at you strangely for being the only one running like mad.
You catch your breath. You're safe, for now.
