GOTO _CC_CLASS

>> _CC_NOKOLIS
SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER NOKOLID
Ah, the Missing God of Death... it is rather difficult to pray to a deity that has long since disappeared (some say died, but you know better, don't you?). But there exist certain, rare artifacts that contain echoes of the Missing God's power.
You are lucky enough to have such an artifact: a fragment of dark but otherwise unassuming metal. You keep it as a talisman.
Your faith is a dangerous one to hold--be cautious who you let uncover the truth of your beliefs and your power.

>> _CC_KASIDIV
SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER KASIDIVIAN
Ah, dread Kasidiv. No other deity's name sparks as much fear. His worship is taboo--illegal, even, when done openly. Those who walk the Bloody Path come to it for many reasons. Why have you?
CHOICE ; I just like killing. > CONT ; I was a soldier. Kasidiv gave me meaning amidst the death. > CONT ; My family was killed by a cult. By the power of Kasidiv, I will destroy them in his name and mine. > CONT;
So be it. Kasidiv will surely be watching your progress.
CHOICE ; My path is marked in blood. > END ;
