And who are you? From where do you hail?
CHOICE ; I am from this country, the Kingdom of Kayland > __CC_KAYLAND ; I hail from the south, the desert kingdom of Siddaér > __CC_SIDDAER ; I hail from the great Elvish state of Tulyra. > __CC_TULYRA ;

>> __CC_KAYLAND
SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER NATIONALITY KAYLAND
Ah, the proud and sturdy kingdom of Kayland. And what is your heritage, then? Are you a human, as are the majority, or perhaps you are one of its many other races?
CHOICE ; I am a human. > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER RACE HUMAN ; I am mixed, partly elvish > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER RACE HALF-ELF ; I am a full-blooded elf > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER RACE ELF ; I am a dwarf. >> SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER RACE DWARF;
GOTO _CC_CLASS

>> __CC_SIDDAER
SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER NATIONALITY SIDDAÉR
Ah, the glorious and learned kingdom of Siddaér. And what is your heritage, then? Are you part-elvish, as are the majority? A dragonborn from the city-state of Kalkariesh, perhaps? Or maybe you are one of its many other races?
CHOICE ; I am mixed, partly elvish > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER RACE HALF-ELF ; I am a Dragonborn. > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER RACE DRAGONBORN ; I am a human. > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER RACE HUMAN;  I am a full-blooded elf > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER RACE ELF; I am a dwarf. >> SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER RACE DWARF;
GOTO _CC_CLASS

>> __CC_TULYRA
SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER NATIONALITY TULYRA
Ah, Tulyra, arrogant and stagnant, all that remains of that great Old Empire of the Elves. And what is your heritage, then? Are you an elf, as are the majority, or perhaps you are one of the relative few of mixed ancestry there?
CHOICE ; I am a full-blooded elf > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER RACE ELF ; I am mixed, of both Elvish and outlander blood. > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER RACE HALF-ELF ;
GOTO _CC_CLASS

>> _CC_CLASS
You are no stranger to combat--or at the very least, your background has prepared you for it. What background would that be?
CHOICE ; I am a fighter. I use strength and traditional weaponry to defeat my opponents > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER CLASS FIGHTER ; I am a mage. I am well-versed in magic, and can use spells in a fight if necessary. > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER CLASS MAGE ; I am a rogue. I have the agility and guile to misdirect and attack my opponents with lethal precision. > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER CLASS ROGUE ; I am a cleric. By following a higher power, I wield divine energy to defeat my foes. > INSERT _CC_CLERIC ;
GOTO _CC_COMPLETE

>> _CC_CLERIC
IF PLAYER HASATTRIBUTE DRAGONBORN ; You are a dragonborn cleric. Do you follow the savior of the dragonborn, Saint Surikenna, the druid who led your people to safety during the Calamitous Invasion?
IF PLAYER HASATTRIBUTE DRAGONBORN ; CHOICE ; Yes, I follow Saint Surikenna, and channel her powers of life and nature. > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER SURIKENNIAN ; No, I follow a different higher power. > And which deity would that be? ;
IF PLAYER NOT HASATTRIBUTE DRAGONBORN ; You gain your strength by following a higher power. Which?
IF PLAYER NOT HASATTRIBUTE SURIKENNIAN ; CHOICE ; Medranas, Great God of Order > _CC_MEDRANAS ; Savaras, Great God of Freedom > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER SAVARASIAN ; Vizendris, Great God of Madness > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER VIZENDRID; Nokolis, the Missing God of Death > _CC_NOKOLIS; Haldrias, Aspect of Justice > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER HALDRIAN; Kasidiv, Aspect of Slaughter, Violence, and Vengeance > _CC_KASIDIV; Lelerian, Ascended God of Knowledge, Patron Deity of Siddaér > ;

>> _CC_MEDRANAS
SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER MEDRANASIAN
Ah, radiant Medranas, the most-widely worshipped deity here in Kayland. They are the patron of the Order of the Red Moon, one of the most powerful factions on the continent and by far its largest religious organization. The Red Moon provides healing services at affordable prices and works in many capacities as town guards, but are characteristically skeptical of magic and magic-users of all kinds.  What is your relation to them?
CHOICE ; I am a member of the Order, and have recently joined. > _CC_RED_MOON; I am not a member of its ranks, but I devoutly visit their temples. > CONT ; I do not associate with them at all. > CONT ;

>> _CC_NOKOLIS
SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER NOKOLID
Ah, the Missing God of Death... it is rather difficult to pray to a deity that has long since disappeared (some say died, but you know better, don't you?). But there exist certain, rare artifacts that contain echoes of the Missing God's power.
You are lucky enough to have such an artifact: a fragment of dark but otherwise unassuming metal. You keep it as a talisman.
Your faith is a dangerous one to hold--be cautious who you let uncover the truth of your beliefs and your power.

>> _CC_KASIDIV
SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER KASIDIVIAN
Ah, dread Kasidiv. No other deity's name sparks so much fear. His worship is taboo--illegal, even, when done openly. Those who walk the Bloody Path come to it for many reasons. Why have you?
CHOICE ; I just like killing. > CONT ; I was a soldier. Kasidiv gave me meaning amidst the death. > CONT ; My family was killed by a cult. By the power of Kasidiv, I will destroy them in his name and mine. > CONT;
So be it. Kasidiv will surely be watching your progress.
CHOICE ; My path is marked in blood. > END ;

>> _CC_LELERIAN
SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER LELERIANITE
Ah, learned Lelerian, God of knowledge, patron of mages, and folk hero and state deity of Siddaér. His worship is quite diverse, and many perspectives on this deity have developed. What sect to you prescribe to?
CHOICE ; I see him as a man ascended to godhood, entirely separate from the other deities, as is standard in Siddaér. > CONT ; I see him as an example of perfect harmony, one who unites the forces of all the Great Four in one being. > SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER HARMONILARIAN ;

>> _CC_RED_MOON
SETATTRIBUTE PLAYER REDMOON
The illustrious Order of the Red Moon. In many respects, the true power here in the North. The Grand Hierophant, its leader, is an Elven man by the name of Parel. He is young, gentle by temperament and generally well-respected, though some in the Order still favor the strong, assertive, and anti-magic policies of his predecessor, the late Grand Hierophant Densa. Time will tell which way the Order will go, and where you fit in amongst their ranks.

>> _CC_COMPLETE
And so you are. The city of Redport awaits you.
