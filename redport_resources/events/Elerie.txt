SAY ELERIE Let me through!
A woman's voice precedes her shoving into the square.
DESCRIBE ELERIE
IF LORE CHECK 1 ; You recognize her crimson robe as the uniform of the Order of the Red Moon--arguably the most powerful group in the Kingdom and by far its largest religious organization.
She kneels down and inspects the black-charred ground where the firey creature exploded.
The woman kneels down, grimaces at the corpses of the gnolls, looking over the smoldering carnage left by the strange creature.
She looks at you, studying you up and down.
SAY ELERIE You fought them? What did you see?
CHOICE ; Explain the scene with the gnolls running out of the alley, followed by the burning creature. > CONT
SAY ELERIE A magmin. Gnolls exist in our world naturally, but a magmin does not. It was summoned by someone. But which came first--the gnolls, or the magmin? Why were they loose in the center of town?
She shakes her head.
SAY ELERIE Some wild mage here for the Arena, no doubt. We told the city this tournament was a bad idea, and now look. The games haven't even started yet, and there are monsters running through the streets. Medranas preserve us.
She looks at you, studying you up and down.
SETNAME ELERIE Elerie
SAY ELERIE Well, thank you for helping put a stop to it. My name's Elerie. You should stop by our temple over there if you need healing, or work, perhaps. The city is dangerous now, and the Order will need all the hands it can get. For now, I suppose I should get to cleaning up this mess.
Elerie sighs.

SAY ELERIE My name's Elerie, by the way. You should stop by our temple over there if you need healing, or work. Or just to talk. I should clean up this mess now, though.
Elerie sighs.

>> INVESTIGATING_MAGMIN_NO_PLAYER
The woman, covered in scratches, blood, and soot, kneels down, panting, surveying a large black burn mark, strewn with three hyena-like corpses.
SAY ELERIE Stand back. This could still be dangerous.
