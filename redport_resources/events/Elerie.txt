SETNAME ELERIE Elerie
SAY ELERIE My name's Elerie, by the way. You should stop by our temple over there if you need healing, or work. Or just to talk. I should clean up this mess now, though.

The woman, covered in scratches, blood, and soot, kneels down, panting, surveying a large black burn mark, strewn with three hyena-like corpses.

DESCRIBE ELERIE
IF LORE CHECK 1 ; You recognize her crimson robe as the uniform of the Order of the Red Moon--arguably the most powerful group in the Kingdom and by far its largest religious organization.

>> __EL_LOOKS_AT_GNOLLS_AND_MAGMIN
She kneels down, grimaces at the corpses of the gnolls, and looks over the smoldering carnage left by the strange creature.
SAY ELERIE A magmin. Who summoned this? Gnolls can be found in the wilds, but this had to have been summoned. And why in the hells were they both loose in the center of town?
She shakes her head.
SAY ELERIE Some crazed mage here for the Arena, no doubt. We told the city this tournament was a bad idea, and now look. The games haven't even started yet, and there are monsters running through the streets. Medranas preserve us.
She looks at you, studying you up and down.

She sighs.
