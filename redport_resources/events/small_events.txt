>> INTRO ; PLAYER IN REDPORT_SQUARE
The sky is clear today, the air pleasantly warm, carrying the subtle scent of sea-salt.
On the western coast, where expansive plains of lime-colored grass meet the sparkling, deep-blue waters of the Dragonshead Gulf, the young city of Redport is the only settlement of its size for over a hundred miles in any direction.
Its mostly single-story buildings have tan walls and red-tile roofs, its narrow roads might be called alleyways in other cities. Save around a small fort on the east side, it has no walls.
It was not built for crowds, but these days it is stuffed to the brim with people.
You stand in the central plaza, a square, a hundred or so feet in width. Stalls and stores with their peddlers and merchants line the perimeter, and your ears are filled with haggling and raucous chatter.
You, amongst a huddle of strangers, observe a public notice board next to a tavern on the plaza’s southern edge. Right in the middle, a huge poster reads: “The House Foxford Arena’s grand opening! Brave gladiators take on fearsome monsters! Riches and titles to be won! Combatants wanted!”
It is this that has drawn the crowds, and perhaps yourself, to Redport. Whatever one’s calling, there is work and prosperity to be found around an event like this.
