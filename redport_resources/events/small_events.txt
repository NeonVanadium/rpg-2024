>> INTRO ; PLAYER IN REDPORT_SQUARE
//The sky is clear today, the air pleasantly warm and carrying the subtle scent of sea-salt.
//This is the burgeoning near-city of Redport. Its buildings, mostly single-story, are iconic for their red-tile roofs and warm, beige walls. Save around a small fort on the east side, it has no walls. It was not built for crowds, but these days it is stuffed to the brim with people.
//You, amongst a huddle of strangers, observe a public notice board next to a tavern in the central square. Right in the middle, a huge poster reads: “The House Foxford Arena’s grand opening! Brave gladiators take on fearsome monsters! Riches and titles to be won! Combatants wanted!”
//It is this that has drawn the crowds, and perhaps yourself, to Redport. Whatever one’s calling, there is work and prosperity to be found around an event like this.
//Suddenly, screams break through the crowd.
As people flee and leave a wide-open berth by the side of the tavern, you see source of the commotion: Gnolls.
They scurry out of the alley and into the square, spit dribbling from their jaws and waving their spears about.

>> INTRO_PRE_GNOLL_FIGHT
The gnolls almost less concerned with the people around them then by... a bright orange light coming from within the alley.
A child-sized creature made, seemingly, of pure magma skips out into the square--sending the gnolls into a frenzy as they try to get away. The screams of terror amplify.
Suddenly, a figure cloaked in red hurries through the crowd.

MOVE PLAYER 30 20
You run as fast as you can, putting the gnolls and the screaming crowds behind you.
You sprint down a zig-zagging sequence of roads and alleys, only stopping once you've fully lost your breath, and the commotion is so far behind that passers-by look at you strangely for being the only one running like mad.
You catch your breath. You're safe, for now.
